# custom-linked-list-iterator
Java-code, that creates custom iterator for custom linked list.
The code is the solution of one of the tasks from the book "Thinking In Java" written by Bruce Eckel. The task is to create a linked list and iterator without using interfaces List and Iterable. Linked list should have only two methods: iterator() for getting iterator and overridden method toString(). Adding and removing of elements shold be possible only using iterator.
